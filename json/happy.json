    "happy" : [
" Nature, oh Nature, so bright and so fair, With the sun shining bright in the summer air, The birds singing sweet in the trees above, The flowers blooming bright, full of love. The green grass growing, the leaves on the trees, All around us, a world full of ease, The rolling hills, the mountains so grand, Nature's beauty, it never doth end. Merry and bright, this joyous season, Nature's bounty, it gives us no reason, To be anything other than glad, Merry and bright, our lives are not sad. So let us revel in Nature's delight, And give thanks for all she has in sight, From the tiniest flower to the tallest tree, Nature's beauty, it sets us free. Nature's beauty is all around In fields and forests, mountains and seas It fills our hearts with joy profound And sets our spirits free The gentle breeze that rustles through The leaves of trees so tall Brings music to our ears anew And soothes our minds with all The chirping birds that sing their song In fields of green and gold Their melodies all day long As sweet as tales untold The sun that rises in the east And sets in the western sky Brings warmth and light, a welcome feast To all who pass it by So let us dance and sing and play In nature's joyous glow For all her wonders bright and gay Will lift our hearts and soothe our souls Nature's beauty, oh so bright, Brings joy and happiness to light. The fields and trees, the birds and bees, All dance and sing with glee. Life's journey, full of cheer, Brings endless joy and cheer. From sun up to sun down, We dance and sing with a crown. The breeze that blows through the trees, Brings a sense of calm and ease. The beauty of the earth, Brings us joy and new birth. So let us all embrace, The joy and love of nature's grace. For life and joy are meant to be shared, With those we love and hold dear."
