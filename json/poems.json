"Another leaf falls down the pavement As I watch the grey sky from inside my flat Just another window in the interminable row of Concrete slabs hereâ€™s a tree just across the street, Its roots defiantly taking their place Crumbling the sidewalk You are my sanctuary, my escape from the city's noise",
      
"Trees stand tall and proud, Nature's guardians, unbound. Their branches reach to the sky, Their leaves a rustling sound.In the Antropocene, We live in a world that's changed. Yet the trees remain a constant, Nature's beauty still unchained.But the trees, they were here first, Their roots deep , their presence tall. Life here is a joy, a simple, quiet hush In this place, I am at peace In this bucolic place, let us rest They are a reminder of what once was, Of times immemorial",
      
"The beauty of the earth, now a mere memory untold. A testament to their resilience, a sight to view. For as long as the trees still stand, there is hope In days of yore, when the world was young, Nature as abound, spoiled by none Nor man nor animal, they couldn't; But as I reach for the stars I am pulled back down To the crumbling ruins Of this dying world I dance and spin in the wind Letting my pen move as it will The trees and the flowers Are just pixels on a screen We scroll and we click Nature's beauty never fades, As the world keeps turning round.",
      
 "The soft rain falls from above, On the earth, it makes a sound. The trees reach for the sky,Their branches dancing in the breeze. The mountains stand tall and proud, A natural masterpiece. The oceans ripple and flow"
